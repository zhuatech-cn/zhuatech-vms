# ZhuaTech Visitor Management System

> A source-available enterprise project by [ZhuaTech](https://www.zhuatech.cn/) for visitor invitation, access, reception, and on-site security management.

ZhuaTech Visitor Management System provides a practical, self-hosted foundation for visitor invitation, access, reception, and on-site security management. It is designed for reception teams, security teams, employees, visitors, and site administrators, with clear business records, controlled workflows, operational visibility, and auditable actions.

This repository is intended for learning, technical evaluation, and non-commercial collaboration. The included implementation, tests, database resources, and container configuration provide a reproducible starting point for further enterprise adaptation.

**Search topics:** enterprise visitor management system, self-hosted visitor management system, Java Spring Boot enterprise software, digital transformation.

## Solution Overview

- **Primary users:** Reception teams, security teams, employees, visitors, and site administrators.
- **Deployment model:** Self-hosted, with container-based local deployment where supported.
- **Governance baseline:** Role-aware operations, validation, approval boundaries, exception handling, and auditability.
- **Production boundary:** Review security, identity, backup, observability, capacity, and compliance controls before production use.

## Business Coverage

- **Visitor invitations and appointments** — Manage visitor invitations and appointments with ownership, validation, and explicit lifecycle states.
- **Identity and access verification** — Coordinate identity and access verification through controlled workflows and approval gates.
- **Reception check-in and passes** — Track reception check-in and passes metrics, exceptions, deadlines, and follow-up actions.
- **Watchlists and risk alerts** — Preserve watchlists and risk alerts evidence in searchable, traceable operational history.
- **Visit lifecycle and notifications** — Expose visit lifecycle and notifications in role-aware user and administration workspaces.
- **Reception analytics and audit evidence** — Connect reception analytics and audit evidence to external systems through configurable integration boundaries.

## Implementation Stack

**Technology stack:** Java 21 · Spring Boot · Vue 3 · Vite · MySQL 8 · Docker Compose
